## Strictness Level: MAXIMUM

**This is the MOST STRICT configuration possible for Flutter development.**

**ZERO TOLERANCE. NO COMPROMISES. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

Every single code quality rule has been enabled and set to ERROR.
Every single metric has been set to the most aggressive threshold.
Every single quality gate is blocking.

**Note**: This configuration represents MAXIMUM POSSIBLE code quality standards - beyond industry-leading. It enforces perfect code quality at all times. Significant refactoring of existing code will be required.
